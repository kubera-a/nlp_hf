    "1. Language\\\n",
    "NLP is overwhelmingly dominated by English therefore pretrained models for low-resource languages are rare.\n",
    "2. Data availability\\\n",
    "Transfer learning is able to cut down on the task specific labeled training data required, however the requirements\n",
    "are still high compared to humans.\n",
    "3. Working with long documents\\\n",
    "Self-attention works well with paragraph-long texts, but it becomes very expensive as you move to longer\n",
    "texts like whole documents.\n",
    "4. Opacity\\\n",
    "It is hard or impossible to unravel \"why\" a model makes a particular decision.\n",
    "5. Bias\\\n",
    "Transformer models are trained on large corpora which usually comes from the internet and therefore this \n",
    "imprints all the inherent bias on the internet onto the model. Therefore railguards are required to address this."
